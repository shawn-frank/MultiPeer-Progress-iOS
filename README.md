# MultiPeer-Progress-iOS
Swift project to demo the use of the MultiPeer framework to send files between 2 iOS devices. 

I have extended this example https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMalaRuie9o&ab_channel=TihomirRAdeff with the following additional
functionality:
- Show the progress in % of the transfer
- Show the speed of transfer in MB/s
- Show the data transferred in MBs

Here is an example which can be viewed at: https://youtu.be/Ug4gJ67B6Vw
